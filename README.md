Red. Green. Blue. Yellow. Black. White. Long ago, the seven colors lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Black Buoys attacked. Only the SVM Classifier, master of all seven colors, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A couple weeks passed and our group discovered the new SVM Classifier, an algorithm named TASCA (Team Avatar SVM Classifier Algorithm). And although his classification skills are great, it has a lot to learn before it's ready to classify anything. But I believe TASCA can classify the world.
