* color constancy - use direction of light as joint variable (behind/front used to explain shading)
* intrinsic image ^^
* weighted majority voting - using lidar to group voting blocks, have the different blobs (colors) each vote
* possibly classify speedgates with segmentation
* possibly classify far buoys with more camera based detection
* knn or gaussian mixture on 3x3 or 5x5 window on picture
* neural networks as alternative
* need lots of data → use generated images? add different false background?


- include pictures of difficult cases in report to show how the classifications are difficult

why not use KNN / majority vote?
each voter would have to already know what color it would vote for. We could set ranges of r/g/b or h/s/v values for these voters to decide what color, but this is the same as the color filters already used on the boat- and these don’t work.
