Color Detection with Supervised Learning




Each summer the autonomous robotic boat team UM:Autonomy at the University of Michigan competes in the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International’s RoboBoat competition held in Virginia Beach, VA, against various robotics labs and other clubs. In testing the robots, buoys frequently mark boundaries or goals, with color often providing significant information in locating the boat or acting as a key component such as when the color of a sound producing buoy must be reported.


Currently the boat relies on color filters to determine color. These are faulty because the tuning is highly susceptible to relying on current lighting conditions, resulting in detections that work well for several hours before deteriorating in accuracy. Additionally the colors white and black are difficult to filter because filters that do so generally have high false positive rates, ending up including very light or very dark patches of water.


The project aims to accurately classify buoy colors in the variety of lighting conditions, creating a robust system that requires minimal maintenance.


Color detection is its own field so there are plenty of resources to draw upon (1). The approach taken by this project is to use color histograms and other local features to determine color, having already been given the segmentation generated by lidar returns. The color histograms are not new as they have been popularized in classifying objects with backprojection (2), but here the goal is only to classify color; the overall object classification is based on segmentation.


The color histogram approach will use the different colors’ frequencies to allow for finer classification boundaries than the current filters, which currently have just minimum and maximum thresholds for RGB values. The supervised learning algorithms will also have the ability to find boundaries that human operators have not. Being supervised, the algorithms will be evaluated by their success rate on test data after cross validation. More physical tests can include actual environmental conditions replicating those at competition, when the boat is in the water.

lidar pointcloud + camera images → to stuff that gets convex hull, then histograms → project


use : libSVM - java implementation


different normalizations for rgb values:
- pixel based: e.g. R := R / (R+G+B)
- channel based: R := R / sum(R)


data collection :
log files → left, right camera images, point cloud


images → draw boxes from which to extract histograms → label color
→ get algo to use box (and any other features) to predict color
